												<h3>Food Vision Multiclass Classification <br /> 
												 </h3>
											</header>
											<p>Project Introduction :-
												The quality and safety of food is an important issue to the whole society, since it is at the basis of human health, social development and stability. Ensuring food quality and safety is a complex process, and all stages of food processing must be considered, from cultivating, harvesting and storage to preparation and consumption. However, these processes are often labour-intensive. Nowadays, the development of machine vision can greatly assist researchers and industries in improving the efficiency of food processing. As a result, machine vision has been widely used in all aspects of food processing. At the same time, image processing is an important component of machine vision. Image processing can take advantage of machine learning and deep learning models to effectively identify the type and quality of food..</p>

												<h3>Second Hand Car Price Prediction</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Predicting the price of second-hand or used cars is an important as well as an interesting problem. The efforts required in achieving the desired price of the used car give a rough sketch about the amount at which the car can be sold at the best price. The challenging part is to find the best price of the used cars based upon the actual features of the car. The features which were used to build the model should be given as input to the system for predicting the price. This ensures that the predicted price is worthy.</p>

												<h3>Pizza And Steak Prediction</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The machine learning models have started penetrating into critical areas like food vision, health care, justice systems, and financial industry. Thus to figure out how the models make the decisions and make sure the decisioning process is aligned with the ethnic requirements.

												Meanwhile, the rapid growth of deep learning models pushes the requirement of interpreting complicated models further. People are eager to apply the power of AI fully on key aspects of everyday life. However, it is hard to do so without enough trust in the models or an efficient procedure to explain unintended behavior.</p>
