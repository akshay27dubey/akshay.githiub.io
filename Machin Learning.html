												<h3>Data Analysis and Price Prediction of  <br /> 
												 Black Friday Sales </h3>
											</header>
											<p>Project Introduction
											Black Friday is an informal name for the Friday following Thanks giving Day in the United States, which is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. The day after Thanksgiving has been regarded as the beginning of the United States Christmas shopping season since 1952, although the term "Black Friday" did not become widely used until more recent decades. Many stores offer highly promoted sales on Black Friday and open very early, such as at midnight, or may even start their sales at some time on Thanksgiving. The major challenge for a Retail store or eCommerce business is to choose product price such that they get maximum profit at the end of the sales. Our project deals with determining the product prices based on the historical retail store sales data. After generating the predictions, our model will help the retail store to decide the price of the products to earn more profits.</p>

												<h3>Census Prediction</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The above introduction had an aim to increase the awareness about how the income factor actually has an impact not only on the personal lives of people, but also an impact on the nation and its betterment. We will today have a look on the data extracted from the 1994 Census bureau database, and try to find insights about how different features have an impact on the income of an individual. Though the data is quite old, and the insights drawn cannot be directly used for derivation in the modern world, but it would surely help us to analyze what role different features play in predicting the income of an individual.</p>

												<h3>Customer Segmentation</h3>
											</header>
											<p>In this project, I will be performing an unsupervised clustering of data on the customer's records from a groceries firm's database. Customer segmentation is the practice of separating customers into groups that reflect similarities among customers in each cluster. I will divide customers into segments to optimize the significance of each customer to the business. To modify products according to distinct needs and behaviours of the customers. It also helps the business to cater to the concerns of different types of customers</p>

												<h3>Detecting Insurance Claims Fraud</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The insurance industries consist of more than thousand companies in worldwide. And collect more than one trillions of dollars premiums in each year. When a person or entity make false insurance claims in order to obtain compensation or benefits to which they are not entitled is known as an insurance fraud. The total cost of an insurance fraud is estimated to be more than forty billions of dollars. So detection of an insurance fraud is a challenging problem for the insurance industry. The traditional approach for fraud detection is based on developing heuristics around fraud indicator. The auto\vehicle insurance fraud is the most prominent type of insurance fraud, which can be done by fake accident claim. In this paper, focusing on detecting the auto\vehicle fraud by using, machine learning technique. Also, the performance will be compared by calculation of confusion matrix. This can help to calculate accuracy, precision, and recall.</p>

												<h3>Stroke  Detection And Prediction</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Stroke is a medical disorder in which the blood arteries in the brain are ruptured, causing damage to the brain. When the supply of blood and other nutrients to the brain is interrupted, symptoms might develop. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke is the greatest cause of death and disability globally. Early recognition of the various warning signs of a stroke can help reduce the severity of the stroke. Different machine learning (ML) models have been developed to predict the likelihood of a stroke occurring in the brain. This research uses a range of physiological parameters and machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT) Classification, Random Forest (RF) Classification, and Voting Classifier, to train four different models for reliable prediction. Random Forest was the best performing algorithm for this task with an accuracy of approximately 96 percent. The dataset used in the development of the method was the open-access Stroke Prediction dataset. The accuracy percentage of the models used in this investigation is significantly higher than that of previous studies, indicating that the models used in this investigation are more reliable. Numerous model comparisons have established their robustness, and the scheme can be deduced from the study analysis.</p>

												<h3>Predicting Heart Disease</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Heart attack prediction is one of the serious causes of morbidity in the worldâ€™s population. The clinical data analysis includes a very crucial disease i.e., cardiovascular disease as one of the most important sections for the prediction. Data Science and machine learning (ML) can be very helpful in the prediction of heart attacks in which different risk factors like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, abnormal pulse rate, diabetes, etc... can be considered. The objective of this study is to optimize the prediction of heart disease using ML.</p>
