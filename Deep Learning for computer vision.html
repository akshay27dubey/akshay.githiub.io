												<h3>Malaria Detection <br /> 
												  </h3>
											</header>
											<p>Project Introduction :-
											Malaria is a significant burden on our healthcare system and it is the major cause of death in many developing countries. It is endemic in some parts of the world which means that the disease is regularly found in the region. Therefore, early testing is necessary to detect malaria and save lives. Thus, it gives us the motivation to make malaria diagnosis more effective and faster. A specialized technology proves essential to combat this problem.Machine learning has recently made headlines in the medical field. The machine learning approaches have proved to be successful in the diagnosis of a disease.

												<h3>Human Emotions Detection</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Human Emotion detection from image is one of the most powerful and challenging research task in social communication. Deep learning (DL) based emotion detection gives performance better than traditional methods with image processing. The design of an artificial intelligence (AI) system capable of emotion detection through facial expressions. The procedure of emotion detection, which includes basically three main steps: face detection, features extraction, and emotion classification. This paper proposed a convolutional neural networks (CNN) based deep learning architecture for emotion detection from images</p>

											<p>The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

												The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class. The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some training batches may contain more images from one class than another. Between them, the training batches contain exactly 5000 images from each class.</p>

												<h3>Human Emotion Detection<h3>
													(FineTuning With VIT Transformer)</h3>
											</header>
											<p>In several fields nowadays, automated emotion recognition has been shown to be a highly powerful tool. Mapping different facial expressions to their respective emotional states is the main objective of facial emotion recognition (FER). In this study, facial expression recognition (FER) was classified using the ResNet-18 model and transformers. This study examines the performance of the Vision Transformer in this task and contrasts our model with cutting-edge models on hybrid datasets. The pipeline and associated procedures for face detection, cropping, and feature extraction using the most recent deep learning model, fine-tuned transformer, are described in this study. The experimental findings demonstrate that our proposed emotion recognition system is capable of being successfully used in practical settings.</p>
